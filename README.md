# Sales-Optimisation-HPC
Leveraging the open-source Hadoop framework, this project explores the dynamic synergy of HDFS (distributed file system) and MapReduce (data processing engine). The central objective revolves around sales analysis, pointing out the most contributing countries and states to overall sales.

Research Question:

The research question for this paper is to determine the total sales of each state by category and which subcategory contributed the most to those sales. The sales manager can use this information for "Strategic Planning" to plan future sales strategies for the state. For example, if the subcategory with the highest contribution was electronics, the sales manager may plan to increase the state's emphasis on electronics sales. Additionally for "Resource Allocation," the sales manager can allocate resources and efforts to the subcategories that contributed the most to the state's sales.
